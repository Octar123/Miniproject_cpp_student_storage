# 🎓 Student Record Management System (C++)

A simple command-line project built using **C++** that allows you to manage student records. It demonstrates file handling, data structures, and basic control flow in C++.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Add new student
- Display all student records
- Search a student by roll number
- Delete a student by roll number
- Menu-driven CLI interface

---

## 📁 How It Works

- All student data is stored in a file named `students.txt`
- Each student has:
  - Roll Number (int)
  - Name (string)
  - Marks (float)
- Data is saved in a space-separated format
- File operations include appending, reading, and rewriting data

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- C++
- File handling (`<fstream>`)
- Structures
- Loops and Conditionals
- Basic command-line input/output
